By default wifibroadcast encapsulates one source UDP packet to one WiFi packet. But mavlink packets are very small (usually less than 100 bytes) and send them in separate packets produces too much overhead. To avoid it use TX with ``-m mavlink_agg_in_ms`` switch to enable mavlink mode. It will accumulate UDP packets while size < ``MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE`` and  ``mavlink_agg_in_ms`` is not expired.
