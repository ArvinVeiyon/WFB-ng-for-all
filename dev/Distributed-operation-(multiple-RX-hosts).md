WFB-NG supports distributed operation with multiple RX antennas on different hosts connected by IP network. You can use multiple hotspots connected
via ethernet and get "pseudo-cellular" network (RX only). For example you can gather video stream from moving transmitter in the forest without any wifi roaming overhead.
